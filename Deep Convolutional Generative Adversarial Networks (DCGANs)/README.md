# DCGANs (Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks)

One of the most interesting parts of Generative Adversarial Networks is the design of the Generator network. The Generator network is able to take random noise and map it into images such that the discriminator cannot tell which images came from the dataset and which images came from the generator.

_This is a very interesting application of neural networks. Typically neural nets map input into a binary output, (1 or 0), maybe a regression output, (some real-valued number), or even multiple categorical outputs, (such as MNIST or CIFAR-10/100)._
